This BlackJack game was made by Selman Unsal

The game is BlackJack, if you know the rules, you can play it

Some stuff that I had to figure out while making this game;
- Calculating score of different card combinations
- How to sort the different cards to figure out the proper score
- Having the Ace as either 1 or 11 depending on the rest of the cards
- Displaying proper end screens and ending the program depending on win style
- Hiding Dealer's card, then revealing it opening the rest one by one

First python game I ever made, and I took me a while to do so...
Hope to have the next one faster...
